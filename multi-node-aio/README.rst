About this repository
---------------------

Full OpenStack deployment using a single OnMetal host from the
Rackspace Public Cloud. This is a multi-node installation using
VMs that have been PXE booted which was done to provide an environment
that is almost exactly what is in production. This script will build, kick
and deploy OpenStack using KVM, OpenStack-Ansible within 12 Nodes
and 1 load balancer all using a Hyper Converged environment.


Process
-------

Create at least one physical host that has public network access and is running
an Ubuntu 14.04/16.04/18.04 LTS Operating system. System assumes that you have an
unpartitioned device with at least 1TB of storage, however you can customize the
size of each VM volume by setting the option ``${VM_DISK_SIZE}``. If you're
using the Rackspace OnMetal servers the drive partitioning will be done for you
by detecting the largest unpartitioned device. If you're doing the deployment on
something other than a Rackspace OnMetal server you may need to set the
``${DATA_DISK_DEVICE}`` variable accordingly. the playbooks will look for a
volume group named "vg01", if this volume group exists no partitioning or setup
on the data disk will take place. To effectively use this process for testing
it's recommended that the host machine have at least 32GiB of RAM.

===========    ========   ============
Physical Host Specs known to work well
--------------------------------------
 CPU CORES      MEMORY     DISK SPACE
===========    ========   ============
    20           124GB       1.3TB
===========    ========   ============

These specs are covered by the Rackspace OnMetal-IO v1/2 Servers.

When your ready, run the build script by executing ``bash ./build.sh``. The
build script current executes a deployment of OpenStack Ansible using the master
branch. If you want to do something other than deploy master you can set the
``${OSA_BRANCH}`` variable to any branch, tag, or SHA.


Post Deployment
---------------

Once deployed you can use virt-manager to manage the KVM instances on the host,
similar to a DRAC or ILO.

LINUX:
    If you're running a linux system as your workstation simply install
    virt-manager from your package manager and connect to the host via
    QEMU/KVM:SSH

OSX:
    If you're running a MAC you can install https://www.xquartz.org/ to have
    access to a X11 client, then make use of X over SSH to connect to the
    virt-manager application. Using X over SSH is covered in
    https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/apple-osx-mountain-lion-mavericks-install-xquartz-server/

WINDOWS:
    If you're running Windows, you can install virt-viewer from the KVM Download
    site.

The root password for all VMs is "**secrete**". This password is being set

Re-kicking VM(s)
----------------

Re-kicking a VM is as simple as stopping a VM, delete the logical volume, create
a new logical volume, start the VM. The VM will come back online, pxe boot, and
install the base OS.

.. code-block:: bash

    virsh destroy "${VM_NAME}"
    lvremove "/dev/mapper/vg01--${VM_NAME}"
    lvcreate -L 60G vg01 -n "${VM_NAME}"
    virsh start "${VM_NAME}"


To rekick all VMs, simply re-execute the ``deploy-vms.yml`` playbook and it will
do it automatically.

.. code-block:: bash

    ansible-playbook -i playbooks/inventory playbooks/deploy-vms.yml

Rerunning the build script
--------------------------

The build script can be rerun at any time. By default it will re-kick the entire
system, destroying all existing VM's.

Deploying OpenStack into the environment
----------------------------------------

While the build script will deploy OpenStack, you can choose to run this
manually. To run a basic deploy using a given branch you can use the following
snippet. Set the ansible option ``osa_branch`` or export the environment
variable ``OSA_BRANCH`` when using the build.sh script.

.. code-block:: bash

    ansible-playbook -i playbooks/inventory playbooks/deploy-osa.yml -vv -e 'osa_branch=master'


Snapshotting an environment before major testing
------------------------------------------------

Running a snapshot on all of the vms before doing major testing is wise as it'll
give you a restore point without having to re-kick the cloud. You can do this by
running the script located at ``scripts/snapshot.sh``. There are two variables that
can be overridden located in the ``vars/snapshot.yml`` file. The ``postfix`` variable
will allow you to have multiple snapshots of a single environment. Just ensure that you
have enough space on the VG to store the snapshots.

In order to revert an environment, simply run the revert script located in the scripts
directory here ``scripts/snapshot_revert.sh`` with the correct ``postfix`` variable set.

Using a file-based backing store with thin-provisioned VM's
-----------------------------------------------------------

If you wish to use a file-based backing store (instead of the default LVM-based
backing store) for the VM's, then set the following option before executing
``build.sh``.

.. code-block:: bash

    export MNAIO_ANSIBLE_PARAMETERS="-e default_vm_disk_mode=file"
    ./build.sh

If you wish to save the current file-based images in order to implement a
thin-provisioned set of VM's which can be saved and re-used, then use the
``save-vms.yml`` playbook. This will stop the VM's and rename the files to
``*-base.img``. Re-executing the ``deploy-vms.yml`` playbook afterwards will
rebuild the VMs from those images.

.. code-block:: bash

    ansible-playbook -i playbooks/inventory playbooks/save-vms.yml
    ansible-playbook -i playbooks/inventory -e default_vm_disk_mode=file playbooks/deploy-vms.yml

To disable this default functionality when re-running ``build.sh`` set the
build not to use the snapshots as follows.

.. code-block:: bash

    export MNAIO_ANSIBLE_PARAMETERS="-e default_vm_disk_mode=file -e vm_use_snapshot=no"
    ./build.sh
